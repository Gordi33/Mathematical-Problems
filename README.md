### [**Combinatorial Thinking - Staircase Problem for taking 1 or 2 steps at a time**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Gordi33/Mathematical-Problems/blob/master/CombinatorialThinking.ipynb)
An alternative solution via **combinatorics**, which aims to provide a combinatorial approach. Comparision to the Fibonacci solution.

### [**Approximate Thinking - Approximation of the area of a circle with regular polygons**](https://nbviewer.org/github/Gordi33/Mathematical-Problems/blob/master/ApproximateThinking.ipynb)
The area of a circle disc is approximated by regular polygons.

### [**Dimensional Reduction - Discrete Reduction of Combinations**](https://nbviewer.org/github/Gordi33/Mathematical-Problems/blob/master/DimensionReduction.ipynb)
The total number of combinations is reduced by breaking them down into its multisets. Each multiset can then be weighted by its number of permutations to reduce the cycle evaluation-run significantly.
